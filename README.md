# ToiletPal

This is a Rails app developed using NYC Open Data for public toilet locations.

This allows users to create accounts and sign in, and then they are able to search for public toilets near them. After finding toilets the user can then see reviews and ratings of the toilets nearby, and leave their own reviews as well as ratings. 

In the next update we will be adding directions functionality from Google Maps, as well as optimizing the site for mobile.
